Problem 1
Part a:
Every action line in a makefile must start with a:
1. TAB

Part b:
make clean
This will call the remove action on files in the current directory (ODIR and IDIR), which would include shape1 and shape2. 

make shape1
This would call the compiler (g++) to create object files from source files, in this case from the $@ variable which is the target (shape1) and $< which is shape1.cpp. It would also call the compiler to pass in CFLAGS, which is set as the options -std=c++11 and -ggdb.

Part (c):
What is the purpose of a .PHONY rule?
This will prevent the make command from getting confused by an actual file called 'clean' and will let it run despite errors from rm.

Part (d):
What are acceptable names for a makefile? Select all that applies.
2. Makefile
4. makefile
