Part (b)
What are the commands you used to place the break points?

break main
break factorial

Part (c)
Now, you need to figure out why all factorials are equal to zero.

Explain in two sentences what the bug was.

The for loop in factorial was setting num equal to 0 every time when it was called since it started at i=0.

What are the sequence of commands (e.g. r, n, ..., print k, ...) you used to figure out the bug?

r
n
n
n
n
n
print num

Part (d)
After fixing this problem, are the factorials correct?

No

Using gdb, debug the factorial() function to fix this bug.

Explain in two sentences what the bug was.

Since the loop was counting up to num and num was being updated after every iteration of the loop, the loop will never finish.

What sequence of commands did you use this time?

break factorial
r
n
n
n
print num
n
n
print num
n
n
print num
